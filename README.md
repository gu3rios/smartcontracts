# smartcontracts
## Whoami ... 
I am curious about technology. I heard something about Blockchain in 2011, and later about Web3. Being curious, 
I saw something interesting in Web3, 
and then in 2025 I started studying smart contracts, aiming to contribute to what I envisioned would be the mass adoption of asset tokenization, RWA, 
and much more than my own vision could reach.   
  
Forty years ago, I started programming in BASIC, then C, and C++. After many years without contact with programming, I decided to take HARVARD's CS50 in 2023, 
and so I am back in development, currently using Solidity as the standard language for writing contracts.
