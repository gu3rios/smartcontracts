# smartcontracts
## Whoami ... 
I am curious about technology. I heard about Blockchain in 2011 and later about Web3. Intrigued, I saw something interesting in Web3 and, 
in 2025, I began studying smart contracts, with the goal of contributing to what I imagined would be the mass adoption of asset tokenization, 
RWA, and much more than my own vision could achieve.

Forty years ago, I started programming in BASIC, then in C and C++. After many years without contact with programming, 
I decided to take HARVARD's CS50 course in 2023 and thus returned to development. Currently, in 2025, I took the University of Nicosia's MOOC, 
a course focused on Web3, and I am currently using Solidity as the standard language for writing smart contracts.
